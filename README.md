# Youtube CLI
Youtube Command Line Player

Are you fed up with YouTube’s endless ads and the frustration of not being able to play background music? YOUTUBE CLI is here to fix that. It lets you enjoy nonstop background music and watch videos smoothly without annoying ads — all in just a few simple steps. You can even download videos as MP3 or MP4 files, so you can listen and watch anytime, anywhere, even offline.

Note: This is a vibe-coded project (meaning it’s not written entirely from scratch). The development process is supported by artificial intelligence (AI), and the underlying logic is inspired by commonly discussed optimization and usage patterns within the community.
